    <h2><ins>Description</ins></h2>
    <p>These soft-boiled, marinated eggs are perfect to add to your ramen soup. I was given this recipe by the owner of a great little ramen shop I stopped at for lunch one day. The eggs turn out beautifully every time.</p>

    <h2><ins>Ingredients</ins></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><ins>Marinade:</ins></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mirin (Japanese rice wine)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cooking sake</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><ins>Directions</ins></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring eggs to room temperature by soaking them in warm water for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a low boil.</li>
        <li>Carefully pierce the bottom of each egg with thumb tack. Gently lower eggs into the boiling water.</li>
        <li>Gently lower eggs into water and boil for 6 minutes 20 seconds. Remove eggs and place in a bowl of ice water until completely cool, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the eggs are cooling, stir together soy sauce, mirin, sake, and pepper for marinade in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Carefully peel cooled eggs; try to start from the middle of the shell and work you way up and down.</li>
        <li>Place whole peeled eggs in marinade. Refrigerate for at least 2 to 4 hours, or up to 2 days for stronger flavor, turning eggs every 30 minutes or as often as you prefer.</li>
        <li>Slice eggs in half when ready to use.</li>
    </ol>
